				<br>Shōyō Hinata (Japanese: 日向ひなた 翔陽しょうよう Hinata Shōyō) is the main protagonist of the Haikyū!! series by Haruichi Furudate. Hinata was motivated to begin playing volleyball when he witnessed a Karasuno High volleyball player nicknamed the Little Giant scoring points against opponents twice his size. After losing his first and only official volleyball match in middle school against Tobio Kageyama, the "King of the Court", Hinata enrolled at Karasuno High, only to find that Kageyama had also chosen to come to Karasuno. For the majority of the series, Hinata was a first-year student at Karasuno and one of the volleyball team's middle blockers. After graduating from high school, he traveled to Brazil to train using beach volleyball for two years. Upon returning to Japan, he became a member of the MSBY Black Jackals , a Division 1 team in the V-League.

				<br>

				<br>Tobio Kageyama (Japanese: 影山かげやま 飛雄とびお Kageyama Tobio) is the deuteragonist of the Haikyū!! series. For the majority of the series, he was a first-year at Karasuno High School, playing as the starting setter for the boys' volleyball club. Initially, he was referred to as the "King of the Court," a derogatory nickname referring to his dictatorial presence on the team given to him by his middle school teammates at Kitagawa Daiichi. He was widely regarded as a volleyball prodigy by many of the prefecture's players and coaches. After joining Karasuno, he manages to change his previously self-centered attitude for the better with the help of his new teammates and 'rediscover' what it means to be a part of a team.

				<br>

				<br>He was chosen to train at the All-Japan youth training camp during his first year of high school and joined the V League as soon as he graduated. He became a part of Japan's national volleyball team at the age of 19, participating in the Rio Olympics in 2016. He is currently playing as a setter for the Japanese V-League Division 1 team Schweiden Adlers.

				<h1 class="ch-h1">Yū Nishinoya</h1>

					<span class="quote">I kept the ball in the air, it's not your place to give up.</span>
					
					<br>

					<br>Yū Nishinoya (Japanese: 西谷にしのや 夕ゆう Nishinoya Yū) was a second-year student at Karasuno High School. He served as the libero for the school's volleyball team and was referred to by his teammates as "Karasuno's Guardian Deity" for his remarkable skill.

					<br>

					<br>Nishinoya is the shortest member of the team, standing at 159.3 cm (now at 160.5 cm as of chapter 207). Despite his shorter stature, he has a fairly muscular build. He regularly styles his wild dark brown hair by ruffling most of it upwards, adding 10 cm to his height; the tiny tuft of hair that falls over his forehead appears to be bleached a dirty blond. His eyes are brown and slanted.

					<br>

					<br>He tends to wear brightly colored shirts that typically have a random four-character idiom printed on either its front or back, such as "One-Man Army" or "Three-Point Headstand". In games, he wears an elbow pad on his right arm in addition to his uniform, unlike the rest of the team.

					<br>Kōshi Sugawara (Japanese: 菅原すがわら 孝支こうし Sugawara Kōshi) was previously a third-year at Karasuno High School; for the majority of the series, he was the vice-captain and substitute setter for the volleyball team.

					<br>

					<br>Sugawara is shown to be average in height with a slender build. He has slightly thick eyebrows, light grey hair and hazel-brown eyes with a birthmark mole under his left eye. He is usually seen with a gentle smile on his face.
